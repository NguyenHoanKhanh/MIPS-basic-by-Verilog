## ðŸ§  About the Project :
Designed and implemented a 32-bit MIPS-style processor in Verilog with a modular architecture including datapath unit, control unit and test bench. This project can handle some instruction fundamental and easy to study how to construct a basic architecture MIPS.

## ðŸš€ Key Feature : 
â€¢ Logic Parsing : Architecture of MIPS 32bit is customed by me to approriate with study in class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Optimize some block to restrict the number of blocks too much in the architecture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Add some more instructions to the original architecture.
