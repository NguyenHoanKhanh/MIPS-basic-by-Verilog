## üìù Project overview :
A 32-bit MIPS-style processor implemented in Verilog with a clean, modular pipeline design. This project aims to provide an educational platform for understanding the fundamental components and data flow of a MIPS processor, including instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back.

Key goals:

‚Ä¢ Illustrate core processor pipeline concepts

‚Ä¢ Simplify interfacing for in-class simulation

‚Ä¢ Offer extensibility for custom instructions and enhancements

## üöÄ Key Feature : 
‚Ä¢ Custom Logic Parsing: Tailored 32-bit MIPS instruction formats to align with course requirements.

‚Ä¢ Optimized Resource Usage: Streamlined modules minimize combinational logic without sacrificing clarity.

‚Ä¢ Extended Instruction Set: Implements additional arithmetic, logic, and shift operations beyond the basic MIPS subset.

‚Ä¢ Modular Design: Separate modules for control, datapath, ALU, register file, and data memory improve maintainability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Pipeline Stages : 
The processor is organized into five primary stages: 

1. Instruction Fetch (IF) :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Module : [`processor.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/processor.v)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Fetches 32-bit instructions via testbench-injected vectors (no external file I/O)

2. Instruction Decode (ID) :

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Module : [`controller.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/controller.v) (decoding and control logic), [`register.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/register.v)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚Ä¢ Extracts opcode, source/destination register indices; performs immediate extension.

3. Execution stage (EX) in [`ALU.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/ALU.v) and [`datapath.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/datapath.v)):
Supports various operations including arithmetic (ADD, SUB, increment, decrement), logic (AND, OR, XOR, complement), comparison, and shift operations (shift left, shift right).

4. Memory stage in [`data_memory.v`](https://github.com/NguyenHoanKhanh/MIPS-basic-by-Verilog/blob/main/data_memory.v)):
Handles memory access operations for load and store instructions. It stores computed results and forwards them to the destination register (rd) for write-back.

5. Write - back stage (WB) : Data from MEM or ALU result written back into the register file.

## ‚úÖ Evaluation : 
After the project, student can understand and construct a fundamental architectur of MIPS 32 bit.
The project may be need to improve in Instruction Fetch to fetching instructions easier than the current version.
