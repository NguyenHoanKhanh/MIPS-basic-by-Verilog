## ðŸ§  About the Project :
Designed and implemented a 32-bit MIPS-style processor in Verilog with a modular architecture including datapath unit, control unit and test bench. This project can handle some instruction fundamental and easy to study how to construct a basic architecture MIPS.

## ðŸš€ Key Feature : 
â€¢ Logic Parsing : Architecture of MIPS 32bit is customed by me to approriate with study in class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Optimize some block to restrict the number of blocks too much in the architecture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Add some more instructions to the original architecture.

## ðŸ§© Project Components : 

â€¢ Architecture built in order :

&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Instruction will be fetching from component external;
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Decoding to separate address of register necessary and is storaged by register file, if it has immediate value, it will be extend by extention block, and decode opcode send to control block.
&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Register
